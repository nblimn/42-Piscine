# 42KL-Piscine
Repository for what I did during my Piscine

Hello, I'm a 19 year old guy as of today and this is the projects that I was able to complete during my time at the August 42KL Piscine 2022.

Mind you that I wasn't able to complete my projects fully.

I think I did well for my Piscine, I mean I was competing with people with degrees and already in the field.  Hahahahahah I'm proud with the progress I've made in a span of 26 days. Now I feel more motivated to hone my programming skills. This month really changed my attitude towards learning something.
